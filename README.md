For the Web Technologies semester project in the summer semester of 2024, 
we are developing a Personal Budget Tracker that allows users to track and categorize their expenses and income. 
The application will also feature the ability to set and monitor saving goals. 
Additionally, we are considering implementing user account management to enhance personalization.
